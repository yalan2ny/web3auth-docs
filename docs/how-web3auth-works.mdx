Web3Auth operates as a wallet infrastructure, providing enhanced flexibility and security for decentralized applications (dApps) and blockchain
wallets. Throughout this documentation, we'll explore the functionality of Web3Auth, showcasing how it produces unique cryptographic key providers for
each user and application.

## High-Level Architecture

The Web3Auth SDK lives solely on the user/application’s front-end client and handles the interactions between OAuth providers and the Auth Network.

The diagram below describes the relationship between the Web3Auth SDKs and integrating applications. It also depicts the difference between the
products Web3Auth offers, to enable a developer-friendly integration of this infrastructure.

### Plug and Play SDKs

A Web3Auth Plug and Play integration process is designed to be developer-friendly, requiring only the initialization of the Web3Auth SDKs and the set
up of necessary configurations. Once integrated into your application, the SDK facilitates the embedding of the login function. This allows developers
to utilize the SDK to authenticate users by invoking the connect function, that can be activated via a login button or any user-triggered event.

Once the user starts the process:

1. User is redirected to our portal (`app.openlogin.com`)
2. Our portal, `app.openlogin.com`, then handles the initial process of login
3. User is redirected to the login/OAuth provider and carries out the authentication process concerning their auth provider
4. User is redirected back to our portal, which then handles the reconstruction of the user’s key
5. Finally, once the user is successfully authenticated, they are redirected back to the application, with a derived key specific to the
   application/wallet

##### Here's a diagram showing this process:

### Core Kit SDKs

The Core Kit SDKs serve as the backbone of the Web3Auth Plug n Play (PnP) SDKs. They form the essence of the Web3Auth infrastructure and allow for
direct usage within decentralized applications (dApps) to foster deeper integration. They are further divided into two types of SDKs:

1. Single Factor Auth SDKs
2. Multi-Factor SDKs, like tKey SDK

#### Single Factor Auth SDKs

These SDKs allow for the integration of a single factor of authentication, such as social login, into your dApp. They are designed to be simple to use
and can be integrated into your dApp with minimal effort, allowing you to directly use the Web3Auth Network for Wallet Management. This is one of the
most common use cases of Web3Auth, however, it is semi-custodial in nature, since the key is custodial to the Auth Provider and the Web3Auth Network.

#### Multi-Factor Auth SDKs

An integral part of this infrastructure is the tKey SDK, the foundational SDK utilized for the implementation of Web3Auth PnP and Core-Kit.

### MPC SDKs

With the Web3Auth infrastructure, your key is divided into multiple parts and stored across your devices and our Auth Network. This ensures that your
key is always available and never stored in a single place. While in the traditional Web3Auth SDK, your key was dynamically reconstructed in the front
end using threshold signatures.

With the new Web3Auth MPC (Multi-Party Computation) architecture, it is **never reconstructed**. Instead, these partial keys are stored across
different locations, and your device is used to make partial signatures for your message/ transaction. These are finally returned to the front end
where using TSS (Threshold Signature Scheme), these signatures are combined to make a final signature. You can use this finally signed
message/transaction to make a transaction on the blockchain.

The Threshold Signature Scheme (TSS) is a cryptographic primitive for distributed key generation and signing. The use of TSS in Web3Auth's Auth
network is a new paradigm that can provide numerous benefits, especially in terms of security.

As you can notice in this diagram above, the final output for the right side TSS architecture are the signatures that can be used to make transactions
on the blockchain.

## Web3Auth Wallet Management Infrastructure

Web3Auth's [Wallet Management Infrastructure](/infrastructure/) enhances security by distributing a user's wallet across various key shares, thereby
avoiding direct exposure of seed phrases. These key shares form a 'web of trust' and enable wallet management akin to multi-factor account handling.
Users employ OAuth logins, trusted devices, and other factors to manage their cryptographic key pairs. Importantly, the complete private keys are not
stored anywhere within the Wallet Infrastructure system, including our databases or any participating nodes.

To create a social login share, users interact with the Web3Auth Auth Network, where key generation operates via a 5/9 consensus system. This setup
guarantees that wallets remain non-custodial, ensuring that neither Web3Auth, Social Login Providers, nor any other party holding a key share can
claim full ownership.

:::tip managing wallets

For managing wallets, our infrastructure uses various cryptographic techniques such as Shamir's Secret Sharing, Threshold Cryptography, and Multi
Party Computation. To know more about how we manage wallets, please refer to our
[Wallet Management and Security of our Infrastructure](/infrastructure/).
